# profanity_finder
A simple program to find profanity words within a comment.
This program accepts comments from a user and checks how much profanity within this comment. In this program, we use the doc2txt python module
to read words from "words.docx". After this, created a CountVectorizer function and with the help of this function, find match percentage
for the comment comparing wit our data set words.docs.
